      This HTML file implements a simple endless‐runner style game.  The player
      controls a hero that runs across a scrolling landscape.  At several
      points during each level the player must choose between two power‑ups
      (represented by a sword and a magic wand).  The selected power determines
      whether the hero can defeat incoming monsters.  If the wrong power is
      chosen then the hero loses a life.  Completing all monsters in a level
      advances to the next level.  A short manifest below allows the game to
      be installed as a progressive web app on Android devices.  See
      `service-worker.js` for offline caching.  MDN notes that PWAs can be
      promoted for installation and appear like platform‑specific apps on the
      device【92065133406526†L136-L150】.
